# computer-attacks-and-countermeasures-labs

This repository contains lab assignments completed for the *Computer Attacks and Countermeasures* course. The course introduces key concepts in network and computer security, emphasizing how attackers exploit system vulnerabilities and how to defend against them.

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to network and computer security with a focus on:

- How intruders gain unauthorized access to systems  
- Methods used to escalate privileges  
- Techniques for securing systems against these attacks  

**Topics Covered Include**:

- Perimeter defenses  
- Intrusion detection systems (IDS)  
- Social engineering  
- Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks  
- Buffer overflows  
- Race conditions  
- Trojans and viruses

## Student Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Develop a foundational understanding of cybersecurity principles.  
2. Analyze and perform cyber-attacks on computer systems in a controlled lab environment.  
3. Protect and defend systems against a variety of attack vectors.  
4. Identify and respond to cybersecurity threats effectively.
